# Latios Framework Mini Demos

This repo contains a collection of small projects used to highlight some of the
features of the Latios Framework.

## Scene Demo

This demo introduces the basic setup of a Latios Framework project. It also
demonstrates scene management, SubSystems, Blackboard Entities, and the
`LatiosWorld.syncPoint`.

The game is a multi-level navigation game with a persistent death counter.

## Grid Demo

This demo introduces many of the powerful features of Latios Core, including
SuperSystems, Explicit System Ordering, Hierarchical System Culling, Collection
Components, and Custom Command Buffers.

The game is a turn-based strategy game which takes place on a 2D grid.

## Color Demo

This demo introduces features from Psyshock and Myri, including Collider
Modification, Psyshock Debug Tools, DistanceQueries, the FindPairs Algorithm,
PhysicsComponentDataFromEntity, and One-Shot Audio Sources. It also showcases
Fluent Queries and an optimized method for instantiating and parenting entities
using InstantiateCommandBuffer.

The simulation involves flying colliders which additively exchange color and
play sound effects on collision.
