# Latios Framework Mini Demos

This repo contains a collection of small projects used to highlight some of the
features of the Latios Framework.

## Scene Demo

This demo introduces the basic setup of a Latios Framework project. It also
demonstrates scene management, `SubSystems`, Blackboard Entities, and the
`LatiosWorld.syncPoint`.

The game is a multi-level navigation game with a persistent death counter.

Currently released for Unity 2020.3.0 and Latios Framework 0.3.

## Grid Demo

This demo introduces many of the powerful features of Latios Core, including
`SuperSystems`, Explicit System Ordering, Hierarchical System Culling,
Collection Components, and Custom Command Buffers.

The game is a turn-based strategy game which takes place on a 2D grid.

Currently released for Unity 2020.3.0 and Latios Framework 0.3.

## Color Demo

This demo introduces features from Psyshock and Myri, including Collider
Modification, Psyshock Debug Tools, queries, the `FindPairs` Algorithm,
`PhysicsComponentDataFromEntity`, and One-Shot Audio Sources. It also showcases
Fluent Queries and an optimized method for instantiating and parenting entities
using `InstantiateCommandBuffer`.

The simulation involves flying colliders which additively exchange color and
play sound effects on collision.

Currently released for Unity 2020.3.0 and Latios Framework 0.3.

## Fireworks Demo

This demo introduces the new random number generation workflow as well as
character controller and ballistic utilities in Psyshock. Myri is also on
display in this demo.

The sandbox features a discrete kinematic FPS character controller with jumping
and crouching abilities. Trigger toggles allow switching to a night mode where
the gun is replaced with a fireworks launcher.

Currently released for Unity 2020.3.25 and Latios Framework 0.4.
